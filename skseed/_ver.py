"""Resolve the package version.

Separate module because ``__version__`` must be assigned before the submodule
imports in ``__init__``, and a function definition in that position makes every
import after it an E402. A dunder assignment there is fine; a ``def`` is not.

The version used to be hardcoded in pyproject.toml AND here, and the two had
already drifted apart. The git tag is the single source of truth now.

    Both lookups fail with ImportError and nothing else worth swallowing:
    ``PackageNotFoundError`` subclasses ``ModuleNotFoundError`` which subclasses
    ``ImportError``, and a missing ``_version`` module raises it directly. Caught
    narrowly on purpose, so a genuine bug in here surfaces instead of silently
    degrading to the fallback string.

    That fallback is deliberately not a plausible number: a wrong-but-believable
